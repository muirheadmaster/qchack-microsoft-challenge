## Project Description:
We explore an implementation of a quantum Oracle in a simplified version of the popular game <b>Battleship</b>. This project should be a great resource for those seeking to solidify their understanding on implementing quantum oracles, as well as using such oracles within Grover's algorithm. We do not require the user to provide any input in the process.

## Instructions on Running the Project:
The entirety of the project can be run on a jupyter notebook server, and the content can be accessed at "Battleship.ipynb" with a Q# Kernel. 
In addition, we also have written two blog posts, which can be accessed here: <b> https://richli0.wixsite.com/microsoftchallenge </b>. They are separated by their content: one is more focused on technical lessons learned, while the other is a collection of personal reflections.

1) Open up your system's terminal or virtual environment console, and `cd` into the directory containing this project (which has been cloned or downloaded to your local machine).

2) Activate the QDK by typing: `conda activate qsharp-env`.
   Check this installation by typing: `python -c "import qsharp"`.

3) Start a jupyter notebook server by typing: `jupyter notebook`.
   Click on `"Battleship.ipynb"`.

4) Enjoy the project by simply running through each cell sequentially at your own pace!
